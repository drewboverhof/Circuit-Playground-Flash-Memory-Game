# Circuit-Playground-Flash-Memory-Game
Game Description and Rules: 

This is a two-level memory/attention based game. Players have to accurately count the number of times LEDs flash by pressing the buttons to match the number of flashes. Level one consists of only one color of flashes, and you will try to count the number of times the LEDs flash. To do this you will wait until the flashes are over and then press the button the number of times you have seen the light turn on. Level two is a little more challenging. Level two involves two different colors that the LEDs will flash. You will need to count each color separately and mark how many times you saw each color using the two buttons. If you guess the correct number of times the lights flash, you will win. In this case, the lights will turn green. If you are off by 1 or 2 flashes, the lights will turn blue, and if you are off by more than 2 flashes, the lights will turn red.

LEDs during game 

During level 1, the LEDs will randomly flash yellow somewhere between 10 and 20 times; the flashes will vary in length and in pauses between flashes. During level two, the LEDs will randomly flash yellow and purple somewhere between 15 and 30 times. Once again, the flashes will vary in length and pauses.  

LEDs after guessing 

After you put in your guess, the LEDs will react based on whether you’re right or wrong. If you click the button(s) the correct number of times, all the LEDs turn green. If you are one or two clicks away, the LEDs turn blue, and if you are more than two clicks off, the LEDs turn red.  

Speaker 

If you are correct, the Speaker plays a winning noise, and if you are wrong, the speaker plays a losing noise.
